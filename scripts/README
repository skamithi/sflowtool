The 'sflowenable' script can be used to configure a device to send
sFlow if it supports the sFlow version 5 SNMP MIB.  Run with no parameters
to see usage instructions.

The following additional scripts are provided as examples to
demonstrate some applications of sflowtool:

1. ipTopTalkers

./sflowtool | ./ipTopTalkers

Generates minute by minute top IP sources.

2. ipTrafficMatrix

./sflowtool | ./ipTrafficMatrix

Generates hourly IP source,destination traffic matrices.

3. sflowRRDLoad/sflowRRDChart.cgi

Makes use of RRDTool <http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/> to
generate input/output traffic charts for each interface monitored using sFlow.

Place both scripts in a directory under your web root and enable cgi scripts
in this directory. Create images and ifdata subdirectories.

./sflowtool | ./sflowRRDLoad

creates RRD database files of the form ifdata/<agent>-<ifIndex>.rrd.

sflowRRDChart.cgi creates a form that allows charts to be created from the
stored data. The charts will be stored in the images directory.
